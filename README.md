# Image-Classification-K-Means-Clustering
This task focuses on image classification using **K-Means clustering** on the **MNIST dataset**, which contains handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The dataset is first loaded using PyTorch and converted into NumPy arrays for easier processing. A visualization step is performed to display sample images, helping to understand their structure. K-Means clustering, an unsupervised learning algorithm, is then applied to group similar images based on pixel intensity patterns. Since the algorithm works without labeled data, it finds inherent patterns within the images and categorizes them into clusters. Finally, the results are analyzed by comparing the predicted clusters with the actual digit labels, demonstrating how unsupervised learning can be used for image classification and pattern recognition.
